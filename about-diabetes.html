                <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
                <p>Diabetes is a medical condition where the body cannot maintain healthy blood glucose levels. Insulin is the hormone enabling the body to properly break down sugars in food; a diabetic is unable to adequately produce insulin, or produce any insulin at all. This can lead to serious health complications if not properly treated. Diabetes technology has seen much innovation in recent years, enabling more effective diabetes management.

                <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>Type 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 10 percent of all diabetes cases. It is an auto-immune condition with unknown causes, although there is a strong genetic link. It cannot be prevented or cured, but it can be managed effectively, leading to a healthy life with few complications. Type 1 diabetes management involves multiple daily insulin injections and regular blood glucose monitoring. Blood glucose levels are affected by many factors, making diabetes management a complicated process.
                    For more information on Type 1 diabetes, see: <a href = "https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/about-diabetes/type-1-diabetes/">Type 1 Diabetes Information.</a>
                </p>
                <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 85 percent of all diabetes cases. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a gradual buildup of insulin resistance in the body. Long term lifestyle choices, such as dietary and exercise habits, have a significant effect on the development of Type 2 diabetes. Genetic and ethnic factors are also significant. Type 2 diabetes can lead to significant health complications if unchecked, but can be managed through healthy eating, regular exercise, and in some cases tablets or insulin. 
                    For more information on Type 2 diabetes, see: <a href = "https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/about-diabetes/type-2-diabetes/">Type 2 Diabetes Information.</a></p>
                <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
                <p>Gestational diabetes can occur during a pregnancy. It can lead to an increased chance of developing Type 2 diabetes, but most often subsides after birth and doesnâ€™t affect the baby.
                    For more information on Gestational diabetes, see: <a href = "https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/about-diabetes/gestational-diabetes/">Gestational Diabetes Information.</a></p>
